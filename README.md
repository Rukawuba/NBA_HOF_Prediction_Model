#Hall Of Fame Career Status?

I started off working on a model to see how a jumpshot could extend ones career..but after research and searching for data, there are just too many factors that play into that to create a predictive model in this situation. So with the help of a mentor of mine I came to a better conclusion of using a model to decihper whether based on a players career, could we see if they had done enough to be apart of the NBA Hall of Fame?
