# Hall of Fame Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for a predictive model built using Logistic Regression to determine whether a player will be inducted into the Hall of Fame or not. The model utilizes historical data of players and their respective attributes to make predictions.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model consists of various features including player statistics, achievements, and career milestones. Each record in the dataset represents a player, with a binary label indicating whether the player has been inducted into the Hall of Fame or not.

## Model
The predictive model is built using Logistic Regression, a popular algorithm for binary classification tasks. Logistic Regression calculates the probability that a given input belongs to a certain class (in this case, whether a player will make the Hall of Fame or not) based on the input features.

## Usage
To use the model:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies listed in requirements.txt.
Run the provided scripts to train the model, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new data.
Customize the model by tweaking hyperparameters or adding/removing features as needed.
Results
The model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are documented in the provided notebooks and/or scripts. These metrics can help assess the model's effectiveness in predicting Hall of Fame inductions.
